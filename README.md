# ArtificalLife
run the search.py file to recreate the experiment that teaches the biped to walk towards the camera without toppling

# fitness evaluation
the fitness of the biped is a scaled combination of the Torso's sensor and the final xCoordinate. 

(Sum of Torso Sensors)*0.002 + xCoordinate -> maximize this fitness function

# body plan
The biped is composed of a Torso, two legs each with two individual parts, and two arms.
